# Ecommerce-Website
Excited to present my MERN stack-powered ecommerce website! This project served as my gateway into mastering the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. Leveraging these cutting-edge technologies, I've developed a feature-rich online shopping platform, seamlessly integrating backend functionalities with a dynamic frontend .

Tech Stack:
MongoDB – NoSQL database for storing user and product data.
Express.js – Web framework for building RESTful APIs.
React.js – Frontend library for a dynamic and interactive UI.
Node.js – Backend runtime environment to run the Express server.


Features:
User Authentication: Secure login/signup with JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
Product Catalog: Browse and filter products by category, price, and ratings.
Shopping Cart: Add products to cart and update quantities.
Checkout Process: Seamless checkout and order management.
Payment Integration: Supports Stripe for secure payments.
Admin Dashboard: Manage products, users, and orders.
